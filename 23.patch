Subject: [PATCH] Fix build on OpenMandriva (and probably other distros)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Building current SDL2_sound on OpenMandriva results in a build failure
(#include "SDL.h" fails); if fixed, it results in a linking failure
(unresolved symbols for everything that's supposed to come from SDL).

Looking at it, the problem is that SDL_sound CMakeLists.txt assumes
"find_package(SDL2 REQUIRED)" sets SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS and
SDL2_LIBRARIES -- when in fact it (or at least the version we have)
sets SDL2_INCLUDE_DIR and SDL2_LIBRARY.

Looks like there are 2 different not fully compatible versions of
FindSDL2.cmake around (ours comes from SDL2 2.0.14).

This patch adds SDL2_INCLUDE_DIR and SDL2_LIBRARY -- works here, and
should be harmless even with the other FindSDL2.cmake (given they'll
just expand to nothing, as SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS and SDL2_LIBRARIES does
here).
